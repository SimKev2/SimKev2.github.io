# SimKev2.github.io

Hello! I am Kevin Simons, this repo is currently made to host my resume site at
<https://kevinsimons.dev>.

In the past I have used this to fulfill college projects as well as host my wedding website, which
is why the commit history is a bit of a mess. This version of my resume site was built mostly from
GitHub's docs <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>.

If you are looking for a software engineer with a focus on infrastructure, please reach out!
