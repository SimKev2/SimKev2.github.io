Hello! I am Kevin Simons, currently employed as a Senior Software Engineer on the Infrastructure
Product team at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/). My job is a mix of site reliability
engineering as well creating products for internal customers.

Some of my favorite projects I have been involved with include:

  - Migrating our company workloads from an in-house container management application to running in
    [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) on their [Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
  - Developing a job running service on top of the Kubernetes Job API to protect our Control Plane
    from becoming overloaded.
  - Fully utilizing our CI/CD system to enable on-demand automated releases of our products.

I enjoy solving technical problems and designing reliable systems. I believe one of the most
important qualities in an engineer is the ability to learn. My time working with infrastructure has
led to learning new systems and integrating them in our environment sometimes within weeks. The
field of software is constantly evolving and I enjoy improving along with it.
