                            I'm Kevin Simons, currently a senior studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I have been interested in programming for many years and the
                            experiences I have gained through Iowa State and my internships have only increased that interest. After graduating I plan to find a job in industry.
                            I have been most interested in dev ops and productivity engineering fields, such as test engineering and build tools. If you are interested you can check

                        <p>In my second semester here I took CprE 186, a course designed to allow students to create a project on their own. I worked in a group of 5 people
                        including myself. We chose to create a music visualizer, our idea being that you could input a .mp3 file and the waveform would show up on our custom
                        LED board, much like the one seen here, in real time. My job was to design and create the LED board consisting of 128 LED's arranged in a 16x8 grid.
                        This involved connecting multiple LED's together so we had 2x2 "nodes" for our outputs. Then soldering wires coming from the nodes onto the Cubieboard gpio pins.
                        The end result was a moving visualizer on the LED display. I was able to learn a lot about practical building of hobby level hardware, 
                        and could now confidently build a small project on my own even if it involves electronics. We made heavy use of our schools
                        Electronic Technology Group for both guidance and hardware.</p>

                        <p>During my junior year I took ComS 309, another project course, where my team and I developed a project with the idea of allowing people living together
                        in an apartment to better manage both household chores, as well as communal groceries and the payments with them. We developed an Android frontend seen here
                        and hosted our backend on Google AppEngine. We were able to both manage and sync schedules across devices, as well as send notifications to anyone who is
                        late on their tasks, and we created a scheduling algorithm to find a time for the group to meet automatically by looking at their calendars. This project 
                        earned us a Best Project Nomination out of 40+ projects. I worked on the backend development for this project, developing the API endpoints the frontent would
                        hit in order to create tasks or retrieve information. This project involved using a lot of Google's App Engine documentation for learning how to best set up
                        our server. I learned a lot more about hosting projects and working with front-end devs in parallel.</p>

                        <p>During a HackISU event in september of 2016, I and a partner created a run training and scheduling software that takes your goal date and distance as input,
                        and will schedule a training program for you. We use the Google Calendar API to read your events between the current date and your goal date and find any 
                        free time in your calendar. Then we take our training schedule and try to find time during the day that we can schedule a run, based on how long the run will be.
                        For this project I mainly worked on the Google Calendar integration and the scheduler algorithm. Using a lot of Google Calendar documentation and some knowledge
                        from my ComS classes, I created my part of the project. I learned a lot about how to interact with third party APIs, and learned more about practical implementations
                        of scheuling algorithms.</p>
