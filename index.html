                            I'm Kevin Simons, currently a senior studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I have been interested in programming for many years and the
                            experiences I have gained through Iowa State and my internships have only increased that interest. After graduating I plan to find a job in industry.
                            I have been most interested in dev ops and productivity engineering fields, such as test engineering and build tools. If you are interested you can check
                            out my <a href="/static/KevinSimonsResume.pdf">resume</a>.

                        <p>In my second semester here I took CprE 186, a course designed to allow students to create a project on their own. I worked in a group of 5 people
                        including myself. We chose to create a music visualizer, our idea being that you could input a .mp3 file and the waveform would show up on our custom
                        LED board, much like the one seen here, in real time. My main part of the project involved setting up our git repo and then much of the actual soldering
                        and wiring of the board. I was able to learn a lot about practical building of hobby level hardware, and could now confidently build a small project on
                        my own even if it involves electronics. We made heavy use of our schools Electronic Technology Group for both guidance and hardware.</p>

                        <p>During my junior year I took ComS 309, another project course, where my team and I developed a project with the idea of allowing people living together
                        in an apartment to better manage both household chores, as well as communal groceries and the payments with them. We developed an Android frontend seen here
                        and hosted our backend on Google AppEngine. We were able to both manage and sync schedules across devices, as well as send notifications to anyone who is
                        late on their tasks, and we created a scheduling algorithm to find a time for the group to meet automatically by looking at their calendars. This project 
                        earned us a Best Project Nomination out of 40+ projects. I worked on the backend development for this project, developing the api endpoints the frontent would
                        hit in order to create tasks or retrieve information. This project involved using a lot of Google's App Engine documentation for learning how to best set up
                        our server. I learned a lot more about hosting projects and working with front-end devs in parallel.</p>
