                            I'm Kevin Simons, currently a senior studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I have been interested in programming for many years and the
                            experiences I have gained through Iowa State and my internships have only increased that interest. After graduating I plan to find a job in industry.
                            I have been most interested in dev ops and productivity engineering fields, such as test engineering and build tools. If you are interested you can check

                            In my second semester here I took CprE 186, a course designed to allow students to create a project on their own. I worked in a group of 5 people
                            including myself. We chose to create a music visualizer, our idea being that you could input a .mp3 file and the waveform would show up on our custom
                            LED board, much like the one seen here, in real time. My job was to design and create the LED board consisting of 128 LED's arranged in a 16x8 grid.
                            This involved connecting multiple LED's together so we had 2x2 "nodes" for our outputs. Then soldering wires coming from the nodes onto the Cubieboard gpio pins.
                            The end result was a moving visualizer on the LED display. I was able to learn a lot about practical building of hobby level hardware, 
                            and could now confidently build a small project on my own even if it involves electronics. We made heavy use of our schools
                            Electronic Technology Group for both guidance and hardware.

                            During my junior year I took ComS 309, another project course, where my team and I developed a project with the idea of allowing people living together
                            in an apartment to better manage both household chores, as well as communal groceries and the payments with them. We developed an Android frontend seen here
                            and hosted our backend on Google AppEngine. We were able to both manage and sync schedules across devices, as well as send notifications to anyone who is
                            late on their tasks, and we created a scheduling algorithm to find a time for the group to meet automatically by looking at their calendars. This project 
                            earned us a Best Project Nomination out of 40+ projects. I worked on the backend development for this project, developing the API endpoints the frontent would
                            hit in order to create tasks or retrieve information. This project involved using a lot of Google's App Engine documentation for learning how to best set up
                            our server. I learned a lot more about hosting projects and working with front-end devs in parallel.

                            During a HackISU event in september of 2016, I and a partner created a run training and scheduling software that takes your goal date and distance as input,
                            and will schedule a training program for you. We use the Google Calendar API to read your events between the current date and your goal date and find any 
                            free time in your calendar. Then we take our training schedule and try to find time during the day that we can schedule a run, based on how long the run will be.
                            For this project I mainly worked on the Google Calendar integration and the scheduler algorithm. Using a lot of Google Calendar documentation and some knowledge
                            from my ComS classes, I created my part of the project. I learned a lot about how to interact with third party APIs, and learned more about practical
                            implementations of scheuling algorithms.

                            The adaptive wireless wearable neuro-stimulator is meant to provide a source of data for study on SIDS. Our device will be worn by infants and take
                            data readings from the various sensors contacting the skin. The device will have a heart beat monitor and accelerometer. It will also keep track 
                            of the date, time, and location of the device. It will be fastened to the infant using a flexible, durable material. Based on the readings and data taken
                            from the database, the device will administer a vibration pulse to the child in the hopes of getting it to move without waking it up to provide stimulation
                            to the child.

                            My role on this project involves managing the server and database, visualizing the data provided to us by our client, and creating a front-end to be
                            used by medical researchers that can visualize the data we collect from all devices. The database is being set up as a SQL database and will need
                            a couple of tables to store the different types of data readings we receive. And visualizing the data provides an interesting challenge as we need
                            a way to visualize possibly hundreds of thousands of data points. Big picture, my job is to record the data and present it to medical professionals in
                            a consumable way.
                            <br><br>
                            This project has thus far given me an opportunity to learn how to set up and use a SQL database, and allowed me to research and learn to use big data
                            graphing libraries. I have also learned more about managing team members roles on projects in order to get the most benefit from the time put in.
